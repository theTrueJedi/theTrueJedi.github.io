#### Cuisipro Cheese Grater
I know it sounds silly to go crazy for a cheese grater, but... here we are. Cheese and other gratables just don't seem to stick to this, making cleanup that much faster and easier. Ours has lasted us probably 5 years at this point, so build quality is top notch as well.

### Coffee Corner ‚òïÔ∏è <a name="coffee"></a>

#### Airscape Coffee Storage
You can keep anything you want in here, but it works great for keeping your beans fresh, and it's available in multiple sizes and finishes. I use the Medium (7") for my "daily driver" coffee ‚Äì whatever bulk beans I've got for French Press and cold brew ‚Äì and a 4" Ceramic in Cobalt Blue for my espresso beans.

#### Bodum Brazil French Press
Tried and true, the Bodum Brazil is inexpensive and gets the job done.

#### Coffee Measuring Spoons
Having a dedicated pair of these hanging by my coffee station has made my morning routine that much easier (especially important, y'know, *before* you've had coffee). I like the 1/8 cup for espresso, and the 1/4 cup for 1 XL french press serving.

#### Munchkin Lulla-Vibe Paddle
For anyone who didn't splurge for the SNOO (or just wants a to-go version), this little battery-operated wonder will help lull your little one to sleep.

#### Philips Avent Pacifiers
**Newborn (0-2 months):** [Soothies](https://amzn.to/3FZzGz1)  
**Infant (2+ months):** [Ultra Air](https://amzn.to/338x42X)  
We found that of all the pacifiers we tried, the **Ultra Air stay in baby's mouth the best**, making for much fewer "jump out of bed to replace the paci" moments throughout the night. A huge win for you and baby both. Note that **for the first several weeks, we preferred the Soothies**, which are recommended while baby is getting used to pacifiers in general, and let you stick your finger into them to hold them in nicely. We transitioned off the Soothies around 6 or 8 weeks and played much less of the game we call "Pacifier Hostage" after that.
